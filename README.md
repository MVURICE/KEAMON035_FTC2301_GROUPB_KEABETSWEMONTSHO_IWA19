## Book Connect WEB application
This web application displays a collection of books on a webpage and allows users to search and browse through them. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and makes use of various modules and functions to manipulate HTML elements on the page.

## Setup
To use this application, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Features

Book Display

The application imports a number of constants and functions from other modules, including the BOOKS_PER_PAGE constant, the authors, genres, and books arrays, and a number of functions related to manipulating HTML elements on the page. The page displays a preview of the first 36 books from the books array, with additional books being loaded as the user scrolls or clicks the "show more" button.

Search

The application allows users to search for books by title using a search overlay. Clicking the search button in the header opens the overlay and focuses on the search title input field.

Settings

The application allows users to customize the color scheme of the page using a settings overlay. Clicking the settings button in the header opens the overlay, where users can select their preferred theme. The application also updates the CSS variables that control the page's color scheme based on the user's selected theme.
